Computational and Systems Biology B.S.	University of California, Los Angeles	Computational and Systems Biology majors select a coherent integration of courses from one of five designated concentrations: bioinformatics, biological data sciences, biomedical systems, neurosystems, or systems biology. The synergy for all concentrations is integrative systems, information, and computational systems modeling sciences in biology. The focus is primarily quantitative, as mastery of advanced quantitative skills is essential for multidisciplinary understanding. Each concentration emphasizes different systems or modalities, and modeling or other computational approaches. For students interested in broad options for postgraduate studies in life sciences and related areas, including medicine, the systems biology concentration covers the widest spectrum of quantitative systems studies at all levels. The other concentrations are more focused. For example, bioinformatics is more focused on computational aspects of genetics and biology at molecular and cellular levels.
