The Sociocultural and Linguistic Anthropology Concentration offers students a program of more focused coursework in these closely related fields. Sociocultural anthropologists study the daily lives of people around the world, both at home and abroad. They conduct field research to get a hands-on feel for people’s lives and passions and examine everything from beauty pageants to political protest marches, from Disney films to the lab practices of nuclear scientists. Sociocultural anthropology distinguishes itself from other disciplines by its conviction that these local and personal details offer a crucial window on the largest processes and problems of our time, from globalization to race relations and violence. Linguistic anthropology complements sociocultural anthropology with detailed attention to spoken and signed languages—their structure and use in the daily lives of people around the world, both at home and abroad. Linguistic anthropologists examine such things as the “English Only" movement in the United States, the persuasive language of advertising and politics, racism and hate speech, oral/gestural storytelling traditions around the world, communication in the classroom, on social media, or at the United Nations, as well as how the way we talk creates our sense of self and reality.All students must discuss their selection of coursework with a departmental adviser.© 2018 University of Illinois Board of TrusteesWeb Privacy Notice Print this page.

The Brain and Cognitive Science major introduces the student to a simple question: How do intelligent systems work? Our world provides two examples of complex intelligent systems—human beings (and possibly some other animals) and intelligent computer systems. Brain and Cognitive Science majors investigate the brain and behavior of intelligent biological systems (e.g. people) from the perspective that the brain is a kind of computer. Consequently, students must learn about how brains and computers work, and how these can explain what we know about mental functions including perception, learning, memory, and language. Brain and Cognitive Science majors make use of discoveries from a number of different disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and anthropology, and has applications to the development of technology in education, health, language sciences, and design.The Brain and Cognitive Science major provides fundamental training in psychology, neuroscience, and computation, and it allows a great deal of flexibility with regard to more advanced courses. The major requires training in statistics, a laboratory course, and the capstone course. Students should contact our Undergraduate Advising Office for help in creating a plan of study and research that best meets their goals and interests.The Psychology Undergraduate Advising Office is open to help students choose patterns of courses relevant to their interests, as well as to help students explore graduate school, professional school, and career options.

For the Degree of Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences, or Bachelor of Science in Liberal Arts and Sciences Major in Individual Plans of StudyMinimum required major and supporting course work normally equates to 51-70 hours.General education: Students must complete the Campus General Education requirements including the campus general education language requirement.Twelve hours of 300- and 400-level courses in the major must be taken on this campus.A Major Plan of Study Form must be completed and submitted to the LAS Student Academic Affairs Office before the end of the fifth semester (60-75 hours). Please see your adviser. Minimum hours required for graduation: 120 hoursDepartmental distinction: To graduate with distinction, a student mustFurther information on requirements for graduation with distinction may be obtained from the secretary of the IPS advisory committee.Students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences may choose any of the undergraduate degree programs offered within the college. These majors and specialized curricula, each with its own pattern of requirements and electives, are continuously reviewed by the sponsoring departments and the college and revised as needed. At the same time, it is not possible to anticipate or specify all possible undergraduate fields of study. So, in order to encourage the growth of new academic disciplines, the college sponsors the experimental major-the Individual Plans of Study program. IPS allows the student to create an original major more appropriate for the individual's educational needs and characterized by a unique pattern of upper-level courses with a new academic direction. Recent IPS students have successfully pursued such innovative majors as Cinematography, Entomology, Neuroscience, Meteorology, and Middle Eastern Studies.The development of an IPS program begins with the student's perception that a more appropriate field of study could exist beyond the present majors. Consultation with the secretary of the IPS advisory committee and with faculty members in related fields will soon establish whether an original major is appropriate. Then, with the cooperation of one or more faculty members who consent to serve as advisers for this IPS program, an IPS major is planned and justified as carefully as if this were a departmental major.Once an IPS program is formulated, the student and adviser make formal application to the IPS advisory committee, which evaluates and decides whether a proposed IPS program is appropriate for the aims of both the student and the college. The IPS Advisory Committee and the college will determine whether BA or BS is appropriate for the proposed program of study. Students interested in IPS are encouraged to inquire as early as possible in the sophomore year. In all cases, IPS programs must be initiated and approved before the end of the student's junior year. If program innovation sounds challenging and attractive, additional information is available at the LAS Student Academic Affairs Office, 2002 Lincoln Hall.© 2018 University of Illinois Board of TrusteesWeb Privacy Notice Print this page.

This undergraduate non-licensure concentration will prepare students to better understand the role of education in enabling equality and cultural understanding in domestic and international perspectives.  Focusing on equality, diversity, and cultural understanding will give students a unique perspective on the historical place of education in both challenging inequities and helping to justify social divisions.  Understanding how education as an institution operates to perpetuate social and economic stratification will give students a perspective on the challenges of creating a more equitable distribution of education.  Classes will cover a wide range of disciplinary approaches, including history, social science, educational policy analysis, and theory.  Students will understand the contemporary and historical barriers to the distribution of education and examine recent human rights-based demands for extending education to people of all social classes, regions, ethnicity, language groups, and genders.Knowing how equity, social justice, and cultural understanding are enabled through education requires an in-depth understanding of domestic and international contexts.  Introductory courses will cover basic definitions of educational justice and educational equality, survey international minorities in the United States or minorities in other countries in relationship to education, and explore political, economic, and social contexts for education. Intermediary classes will invite students to apply their basic understanding of such processes to more local and detailed contexts, like shifts in the U.S. that have extended public schooling and higher education opportunities to historically marginalized populations such as people of color, immigrants, women and citizens from low socioeconomic status.  Advanced classes will introduce students to the theoretical approaches to studying social justice and difference, including Critical Race Theory, transnational and global theory, and globalized critical pedagogy.These courses will be designed to appeal to international and domestic students seeking employment in both the United States and international educational settings, including teaching English as a second language.  In addition, understanding the role of education in fostering the expansion of universal human rights will enable students interested in international business and NGOs to explore the problems and potentials of policies intent on improving conditions in the United States and abroad.  As all areas of study and trade are increasingly situated in transnational networks, the concentration in Educational Equality and Cultural Understanding provides a firm grounding on key issues of rights, obligations, and new institutions that help maintain commitments for educational equity and justice under these new circumstances.Students are encouraged to pursue a minor or a coherent set of electives from several departments as approved by their adviser.  Suggested minors are:  English as a Second Language, African-American Studies, Asian American Studies, Global Studies, Latina/Latino Studies, South Asian Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, or LGBT/Queer Studies.A minimum of 120 semester hours is necessary for graduation in the Learning and Education Studies program.  Students will spend much of the first two years with general education courses, achieving a solid preparation in the humanities, social and natural sciences, technology and mathematics.  In the final two years of the major, students will take a set of core courses, as well as coursework in one of the concentrations. Degree RequirementsThe following degree requirements also meet general education course requirements and must be selected from the campus general education course list.  Selections of core requirements courses should be made in consultation with the adviser.Total minimum hours include general education, language other than English, concentration and core credits.General Education Requirement.

for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Materials Science & EngineeringMaterials science and engineering is the basis for all engineering. Improvements in the quality of life require knowledge of the processing and properties of current materials and the design, development and application of new materials. The Materials Science and Engineering (MatSE) curriculum provides an understanding of the underlying principles of synthesis and processing of materials and of the interrelationships between structure, properties, and processing. Students learn how to create advanced materials and systems required, e.g., for flexible electronic displays and photonics that will change communications technologies, for site specific drug delivery, for self-healing materials, for enabling the transition to a hydrogen-based economy, and for more efficient photovoltaics and nuclear systems for energy production. The curriculum uses concepts from both basic physics and chemistry and provides a detailed knowledge of what makes the materials we use every day behave as they do.Students in the first two years take courses in general areas of science and engineering as well as courses introducing the concepts in MatSE. In the third year, students study the common, central issues related to MatSE. In the senior year, students focus on an area of MatSE of their greatest interest, providing them with the detailed knowledge to be immediately useful to corporations, become entrepreneurs, or to provide the underpinning knowledge for graduate study.

Students choose from the following concentrations:The Psychology major is a broad-based curriculum within a research-focused department. The program is designed both for students interested in a liberal arts education with psychology as a focal area and for students who plan to attend graduate or professional school either in psychology or in a different field such as medicine, law, social work, business administration, counseling, labor relations and many others.The Psychology major provides both depth and breadth of knowledge in Psychology. The major consists of an introductory course, a statistics course, a breadth of knowledge or foundation in the different areas of psychology that comes from a set of core courses, a research methods course, and elective courses that give students a depth of knowledge. Each concentration, except for intradisciplinary psychology, has a core course specific to that area of psychology with a research methods course designed for that concentration. In formulating their Plan of Study, students can decide either to undertake a concentration in Intradisciplinary Psychology and select courses that focus on their own unique interests or to specialize in a particular area of Psychology by fulfilling the requirements for one of the other concentrations listed below. As undergraduate students fulfill the requirements, they also have the opportunity to participate in current research projects by working in labs. Students should contact our Undergraduate Advising Office for help in creating a plan of study and research that best meets their goals and interests.The Department of Psychology also offers a BSLAS in Brain & Cognitive Science.The Psychology Undergraduate Advising Office is open to help students choose patterns of courses relevant to their interests, as well as to help students explore graduate school, professional school, and career options. Advising is done by an award-winning staff of academic professionals along with mentoring by faculty for students with research interests. Peer registration assistants are also available to help with the registration process.Psychology is the scientific investigation of human and animal behavior. Psychologists study behavior in systems ranging from single cells to the individual person, from small groups of people to communities. Psychologists strive to describe behavior and to understand its underlying biological and social mechanisms. This enterprise, designed to better understand the human condition, accumulates knowledge that can help solve problems faced by individuals and by communities. Students that graduate with a major in psychology acquire a wide range of knowledge and useful skills that allows them to find employment in many different areas.Areas of interest in psychology, and many of these are reflected in the similarly-titled concentrations that are available within the major:The states of Illinois, New Mexico and Louisiana now allow appropriately qualified psychologists to write prescriptions for psychotropic medications, if they have the necessary training. There are many other states that currently have pending prescriptive authority legislative initiatives. One component of becoming a prescribing psychologist is completion of the following undergraduate courses:• 2-semester course sequence in chemistry or biochemistry with lab• 1 semester microbiology with lab• 1 semester general biology for science majors• 1 semester physiology• 1 semester human anatomy• 1 semester physiology and anatomy• Medical terminology (class or proficiency)For more information on becoming a prescribing psychologist and a detailed list of which courses meet these requirements, please consult with one of the academic advisors in psychology.© 2018 University of Illinois Board of TrusteesWeb Privacy Notice Print this page.

for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts & Sciences Major in Russian, East European, & Eurasian StudiesThe Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center offers an interdisciplinary major and minor in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies (REEES). These programs involve students in the study of an important and complex world area in a manner that draws together the approaches of different disciplines, while at the same time building knowledge in a single discipline. A student will construct an individual program of study, depending on the student's interests and career goals, in consultation with the undergraduate advisor of the Center.The major in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies consists of three components: 1) language study (Russian, Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Turkish, and more); 2) a multidisciplinary area studies focus; and 3) concentration in a single discipline. Language study can be in Russian or in any of the other languages of the region offered at the University. Students also take courses in a variety of disciplines (history, sociology, political science) and develop a broad expertise in the history, politics, and culture of the region that includes Russia, but also many other countries, from the Czech Republic to Estonia to Uzbekistan. In addition, the concentration in a single discipline provides students with deep knowledge of a specific field that can qualify them for graduate or professional study. Many students also use this concentration to double major. With this program, the REEES major provides students with an interdisciplinary focus on issues critical to the region and foundational language training necessary for professional specialization in the area.Students often go on to careers in government service (foreign service, FBI, CIA) or to work at NGOs (environment, human rights, and other international careers) in addition to publishing, editing, writing, translation, international business, law, teaching, and research.REEES is one of two "Russian" majors (and minors) at the University of Illinois. What is the difference between them and which is the right one for you?The REEES major has a current affairs focus and multidisciplinary area studies that develops students’ skill sets in the humanities, social sciences, and other fields. The major in Slavic Studies emphasizes the study of language and literature, and students develop intensive cultural literacy and communication skills through humanities-oriented training. Many Slavic Studies majors go on to careers in writing and editing, media, or work with international cultural foundations and organizations. Both majors are excellent preparation for law school or graduate school and careers in teaching or research.for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts & Sciences Major in Russian, East European, & Eurasian StudiesA Major Plan of Study Form must be completed and submitted to the LAS Student Affairs Office before the end of the fifth semester (60-75 hours).

Large-scale societal change begins with individuals like you -- hungry for knowledge and ready to make a real difference; in the Department of Sociology you will study the inner workings of society with a focus on either Inequalities or Global Sociology.Sociologists explore human social life at every level, from personal relationships to global society. Major topics of study include inequality, social movements, criminology, race and class relations, gender, social institutions such as religion and education, and fundamental population processes like immigration and mortality. Sociologists use a range of methods and theories to develop and evaluate ideas about social life.As a student of Sociology, you will train in research methods and become fluent in social statistics while understanding the complexity of societal diversity and social change. These skills are usable in a wide variety of work settings and are skills that employers value.Recent graduates have pursued careers with the FBI, as Human Resource Specialists, with non-profit organizations, as policy officers, and have earned advanced degrees in Social Work, Sociology, Law, Medicine, and more. The career paths of Sociology alumni are as diverse as our student population -- who represent the best and the brightest from a variety of backgrounds.In the Department of Sociology you can choose the major in Sociology, the minor in Sociology, or the minor in Criminology, Law and Society (CLS). Whereas the major and minor in Sociology provide an overview into the broader disciplines of Sociology, the minor in CLS is a more specialized approach for those students intersted in law and justice related careers and occupations.Each student should see a Sociology departmental advisor at least once a year to choose sociology courses and to monitor their progress.A Major Plan of Study Form must be completed and submitted to the LAS Student Academic Affairs Office before the end of the fifth semester (60-75 hours). Please see your adviser.Departmental distinction: In order to achieve distinction, high distinction, or highest distinction, a sociology major must meet the following requirements:If a statistics course is taken outside the Department of Sociology to fulfill this requirement, that course does not count toward the 32 hours of Sociology courses.Supporting course work is designed to expand the student’s education, and should be taken outside of Sociology. A student may take supporting course work from one department, such as psychology, economics, history, or statistics, or from a cohesive selection of courses in various units. With an advisor’s approval, departmental or interdisciplinary minors, or a double major, may be used to fulfill the requirements of supporting course work.© 2018 University of Illinois Board of TrusteesWeb Privacy Notice Print this page.
