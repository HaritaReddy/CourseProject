Doctor of Philosophy with a Major in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization < Georgia Tech: One of the most rapidly growing areas of research in applied mathematics, computer science, and operations research has been dealing with discrete structures. This has been most evident in the fields of combinatorics, discrete optimization, and the analysis of algorithms. Increasingly, work in each of these subjects has come to depend on knowledge of all of them. Indeed, many of the most significant advances have resulted from the efforts of researchers in more than one, if not all three, of these areas.In response to these developments, Georgia Tech has introduced a doctoral degree program in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO). This multidisciplinary program is sponsored jointly by the School of Mathematics, the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the College of Computing. Faculty for the program are drawn from these three sponsoring units, as well as from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the College of Business.The ACO program is arranged to bring together the study of discrete structures and the design and analysis of algorithms in areas such as graph theory, integer programming, combinatorial optimization, and polyhedral theory. It is intended for students possessing a strong background in one or more of the fields represented by the three sponsoring units. Each student in the program has a single home department chosen from the School of Mathematics, the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the College of Computing. Courses for the program are drawn from all three of these units, and include study in such areas as combinatorial methods, algebraic structures, probability, the analysis of algorithms, computational complexity, linear programming, discrete optimization, and convex analysis.The College of Computing is one of the sponsors of the multidisciplinary program in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO), an approved doctoral degree program at Georgia Tech. The other sponsoring units are the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering and the School of Mathematics. The degree program is administered by an oversight committee drawn primarily from the sponsoring units.The study of discrete structures is a rapidly growing area in computer science, applied mathematics, and operations research, most obviously in the analysis of algorithms, combinatorics, and discrete optimization. Collaborative work among the three traditionally separate disciplines is already common. The doctorate in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization will prepare students for careers in this exciting and expanding field.Students are expected to be well prepared in at least one of the three fields represented by the sponsoring units (computer science, mathematics, and operations research). Each student in the program is admitted through one of the three sponsoring units, which serves as the home department. Coursework is drawn from all three disciplines. The research advisor may be any member of the ACO program faculty, which is drawn from electrical and computer engineering, management, and other disciplines in addition to the three sponsoring units.PhD A.C.O.

Master of Industrial Design (MID) < Georgia Tech: Industrial design is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer. The industrial designer's work touches all of our lives in the form of home products and furnishings, communication devices, healthcare equipment, rehabilitation technologies, and a myriad of other consumer and industrial products and services. While giving form to the efforts of industry, the designer is at the same time a consumer advocate, providing the humanizing link between technology and people. As such, the industrial designer's central responsibilities include fitting the artifact, system, or service to the person through considering appropriate aesthetics and ergonomics, technical processes, requirements for manufacture, marketing opportunities, and economic constraints.At the graduate-level, Georgia Tech’s Master’s of Industrial Design (MID) focuses on an inclusive design approach that is dedicated to the creation and development of products, systems, services and environments that are usable by all segments of the population. With the growing diversity of the population, inclusive design is becoming increasingly important to designers of tomorrow to ensure that design is responsive to the individual and collective needs of all people.Capitalizing on Georgia Tech’s rich traditions in technology and research, the MID program stresses a user-centered design process and evidence-based design practice that offers students unique opportunities to explore the design of new and existing technologies. Faculty members, who are practicing designers and experts in their fields, maintain active research programs in tangible products within communication technologies, enabling environments, supportive product systems, rehabilitation technologies, and healthcare systems technologies.The Georgia Tech MID program offers a well-rounded course of study with early emphasis on exercising design principles and developing project-based design skills. Design projects stress realistic design situations, where students can have the opportunity to be involved in sponsored and/or funded projects. Within this model, the program encourages students to expand individual disciplinary talents and respond to changing opportunities in the field.Students who have an undergraduate degree in industrial design from an undergraduate ID program similar to Georgia Tech’s can complete a two-year program consisting of 48 graduate credits.Students who do not have an undergraduate degree in industrial design will need to successfully complete an additional 28 undergraduate industrial design credits, which at a minimum includes one year of undergraduate industrial design studios, Advanced Sketching, History of Industrial Design, Industrial Design Computing I and II, and Professional ID Practices. These classes are the minimum requirements students with a previous degree other than industrial design need before proceeding into the graduate-level studios and coursework.All graduate students will be reviewed each year for satisfactory progress. Credit toward the MID degree will be granted for courses in which a grade of C or higher is earned. https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/masters-industrial-design/

Doctor of Philosophy with a Major in International Affairs, Science and Technology < Georgia Tech: The PhD in International Affairs, Science and Technology program provides a unique opportunity for students with backgrounds in either social sciences or science and technology to deepen their understanding of international affairs through the advanced study of sub-fields such as international relations theory, international security, international political economy, comparative politics, and methods for social scientific research. There is widespread recognition that a number of important problems in international affairs – such as how to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or how to promote economic growth in the developing world – cannot properly be understood without an appreciation of the scientific and technological issues involved. At the same time, it is evident that neither the development nor the impact of new technologies is confined within state or national boundaries. Scientific innovation increasingly depends on international collaboration, while the consequences of those innovations, for example in terms of their environmental impact, similarly demand international coordination to be monitored and regulated. Graduates of this research-oriented program will be well placed to embark on careers in academic research, or to move into the policy world where their dual expertise will be rare and highly valued. https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/international-affairs-science-technology-phd
